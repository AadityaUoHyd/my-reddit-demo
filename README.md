# my-reddit-demo

- Reddit is a famous social networking site. Here I'm trying to mock few basic functions of it for building a demo purpose. For example,
  login with registering, login with username & password with email verification, creating communities, posting stuff, commenting & voting on post, etc.

- Reddit demo built using Spring Boot, Spring Security with JPA Authentication, Spring Data JPA with MySQL, Spring MVC. The frontend is built 
using Angular where as backend by spring boot.
